# portfolio
My personal web portfolio built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4 and Django.

This app is deployed on heroku at https://sanjitha-singh.herokuapp.com/

You can clone the project and get started with making your own portfolio.
There are two models that are registered in the admin panel : Jobs and Projects.
A third model, Skill, is mapped to each of these through a many-to-many relationship.
